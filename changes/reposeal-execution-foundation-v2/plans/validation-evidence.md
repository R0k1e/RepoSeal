| --- | --- | --- |
| GRAPH | EXEC-004 | Resolve named member/final gates and required shards from Core, profiles, and repository additions. |
| RECEIPT | EXEC-004 | Bind receipts to code, configuration, profiles, graph, lockfiles, tools, and executed work. |

cross-toolchain evidence through public validation operations.
